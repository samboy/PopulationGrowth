Since we are going over the story of Noah’s Flood in our Bible study,
I looked up how plausible this story is; it’s not, not without a large
number of miracles done by God in ancient times.

See this:

The next thing is to look at the repopulation after Noah’s flood.
Again, the repopulation models are not viable based on historical
events:

Back in 2004, someone modelled this with a small Java program and
saw that the numbers are pretty silly:

Even more recently than that, the Creation Ministries International
made a model using C# and decided post-Ark repopulation was feasible.
They didn’t show us their homework, of course:

So, that in mind, can I update the May 2004 model here in 2022 to
see how feasible populating the world is post-Ark.
