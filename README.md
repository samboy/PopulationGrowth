Since we are going over the story of Noah’s Flood in our Bible study,
I looked up how plausible this story is; it’s not, not without a large
number of miracles done by God in ancient times.

# Repopulation

The next thing is to look at the repopulation after Noah’s flood.
Again, the repopulation models appear to not be viable based on historical
events:

Back in 2004, someone modelled this with a small Java program and
saw that the numbers are pretty silly:

Even more recently than that, the Creation Ministries International
made a model using C# and decided post-Ark repopulation was feasible.
They didn’t show us their homework, of course:

So, that in mind, can I update the May 2004 model here in 2022 to
see how feasible populating the world is post-Ark.

# Work

I have written a Lua script which models population growth.  I assume
that God does a number of miracles after Noah and his family leave the
ark:

* Every wife, being born *before* Genesis 6:3 can have children when
  they are hundreds of years old
* Every person born before the flood lives to be 1,000 years old (this
  is older than the numbers given in the Bible, but this is a “back of 
  the envelope” calculation)
* Every person born after the flood lives to be 120 years old
* Every female, upon reaching 12 years of age (it was a long time ago)
  immediately becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child (5% of the time,
  twins) nine months later.  Upon giving birth, the female immediately
  becomes pregnant again.
* Every woman can become pregnant until they turn 50.  Indeed, every woman
  is constantly pregnant and gives birth every nine months from the ages of
  12 until they are 50.  In other words, every woman has 55, often times
  more (twins!), children.
* There are no stillbirths, every girl lives until they are child bearing
  age (indeed, until they are 120), and every girl becomes a baby making 
  machine.
* The model has an element for each and every member of the population;
  we do not approximate but create an entire simulated population.
* 52% of new births are women.  This is higher than real numbers, but God
  is performing a bunch of miracles with the ancient people.

Now, assuming all of that, we get something like this:

|      |      |
|------|------|
|Years after leaving ark|94|
|Year|2276 BC|
|Population|9184152|
|Living|9184152|
|Girls|4775777|
|Men|804748|
|Women|870199|
|Adults|1674947|
|Pregnant women|862511|
|Avg. weeks pregnant|16.726057986507|
|Children|7509205|

Point being, we get 10,000,000 people within 100 years from a population
of eight under ideal circumstances for human birth.  So, if God did the
miracle of making people as fertile as possible, and if every girl starts
making babies at the age of 12 (yes, I know, but this was a *long time*
ago) until they are 50, then we can have, say, enough people in Egypt 
to start building the pyramids within 100 years of the flood ending 
and the Ark inhabitants repopulating the word. 

Mind you, either the flood happened sooner than we think or the 
Pyramid of Djoser (ca. 2650 BCE) was built later than we think, but we
can have 10,000,000 people within 100 years, then they can cool off
their birth rate and instead do things like build pyramids.
